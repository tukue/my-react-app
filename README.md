# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#####
deploying react app using aws amplify

amplify init: This command initializes a new Amplify project in your React app. It creates a new directory called 'amplify' in your project root, which contains configuration files for your AWS resources.

amplify add hosting: This sets up hosting for your application. When you choose CloudFront and S3, it creates an S3 bucket to store your static files and sets up a CloudFront distribution to serve these files with low latency.

amplify publish: This command does several things:

It builds your React application (similar to running npm run build)
It uploads the built files to the S3 bucket created earlier
It updates the CloudFront distribution to serve the new files
It provides you with a URL where your app is now accessible  

redeploying application after front end updates: 
top update hosted web app :
npm run build
upload new build to s3 bucket and invalidate cloudfoemation cache
aws s3 sync build/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete 
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
